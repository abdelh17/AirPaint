# CameraPaint - Hand Gesture Drawing with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project was created for a hackathon and allows you to draw and erase on the screen using 
hand gestures detected by a camera. You can switch between drawing and erasing modes, change colors, 
and clear the canvas. It's a fun way to interact with your computer using hand gestures!

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
* MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script with `CameraPaint.py`. Ensure that your camera is available and functioning.
4. Use the following keyboard shortcuts to control the drawing:
   - `w`: Clear the canvas
   - `e`: Toggle eraser mode
   - `r`: Set the color to red
   - `g`: Set the color to green
   - `b`: Set the color to blue
   - `q`: Quit the application
   - To toggle between drawing and non-drawing touch your index with your thumb


## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Select your hand preference (right or left) when prompted.
3. Use hand gestures to draw or erase on the canvas.
4. Experiment with different colors and modes to create your drawings.
